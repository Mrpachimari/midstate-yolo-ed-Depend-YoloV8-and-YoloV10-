# Enhanced Retail Self-Checkout System based on YOLOv8 and YOLOv10 Networks

This project focuses on innovating the retail self-checkout process using advanced object detection techniques provided by YOLOv8 and YOLOv10 networks. Our implementation enhances the traditional self-checkout experience through improved accuracy and real-time detection capabilities.
